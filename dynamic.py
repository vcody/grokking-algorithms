# Dynamic programming - solve sub-problems, building up to main problem
# Row-ordering doesn't matter
# e.g. Knapsack problem, git diff, DNA strand similarities, etc.

# Exercises 
# 9.1. No

# Only works on discrete problems, i.e., doesn't depend on other subproblems

# Exercises
# 9.2. Camera, food, water

# Useful for optimizing something given constraint

# General dynamic programming tips:
# 1. Each solution involves a grid 
# 2. Values in cells = values being optimized
# 3. Think about how to divide problem into subproblems
